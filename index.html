    <p>This website is very much a work in progress and is an AI assisted build, the AI started off by making a page, I then took that and put it into Notepad and Visual Studio and went through the code from there, tweaking the content and making the site 'pop' a bit more.  The purpose of this site is to showcase my HTML skills while keeping a basic website going, no Java needed.  The 'contact us' form doesn't work yet.</p>
    <p>Check <a href="pages/AI.html">this</a> out and see <a href="pages/about.html">here</a> for more information.</p>

    <p>Have a great day</p>
