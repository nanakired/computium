        <p>This website is very much a work in progress and is an AI assisted build, the AI started off by making a page, I then took that and put it into Notepad and Visual Studio and went through the code from there, tweaking the content and making the site 'pop' a bit more.  The purpose of this site is to showcase my HTML skills while keeping a basic website going, no Java needed.</p>
        <p>Check <a href="pages/AI.html">this</a> out and see <a href="pages/about.html">here</a> for more information.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>Have a question or need a service? Fill out an email and we will get back to you.  I could make a form and make this bit all snazzy but unfortunately that would require using PHP, Ruby, Python or any sort of web-server language which Github Pages does not support at this time.</p>
